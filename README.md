# Computational Physics WS 2015/16

The lecture introduces advanced students to numerical methods and concepts relevant for physics.



# Linux

The operating system used in the lab classes will be Linux. It is recommended that students make themselves familiar with Linux, since it is the most easy way to get access to a C++ compiler. There is a wide variety of different Linux distributions available. For beginners it might be good to pick one of the more popular distributions, since then you have good chances that you can find a lot of solutions to common problems on the internet. OpenSuse, Fedora and Ubuntu are examples for such distributions.

If you have a Mac, then just grab the XCode package from the app-store and subsequently install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/). With this you should be set. 

If you want to run Linux on your computer, you have three different possibilities, each one having advantages and disadvantages:
- install Linux next to your Windows,
- run Linux in a virtual machine under Windows,
- run Linux from a USB drive.

Installing Linux next to Windows and then choose which OS to run at boot time would be the ideal situation. However, if you already have a running Windows on your computer and no free partitions on your hard disk, it is maybe the most complicated out of the three possibilities to set up.

Running Linux in a virtual machine is the preferred option. The basic idea is that you run Linux on a simulated computer under Windows. Sounds slow and complicated, but is rather simple to set-up. The software which you need to simulate that virtual computer is called [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) and it is free.

If for some reason the solution using VirtualBox should not work, you can use a USB stick and boot Linux from there. For Windows there is an excellent tool to create a Linux USB stick, the [Linux Live USB creator](http://www.linuxliveusb.com) (short LiLi). It offers a broad range of different Linux distributions which it can download and deploy to the USB stick. Since you will want to make modifications to your live Linux, such as installing additional software (e.g. the C++ compiler) you should choose a distribution which offers *persistence* (see the docs on the website which Linux distributions offer this feature).
